# Inspiration for your meetups
Hey there, 

Running a local user group is lots of fun, but can also be challenging. So many ideas, so little time! We're here to help you out. On this page, you can find templates for possible meetups and other material you can draw inspiration from. 

If you've got any questions or comments: always feel free to reach out! 

You rock!
